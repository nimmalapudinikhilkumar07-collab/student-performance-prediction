# Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
To predict a student's final score using numerical features such as study hours, attendance, and previous scores.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset contains student academic performance data with numerical features.

## Approach
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Checked correlations between features
- Built a multi-feature Linear Regression model
- Evaluated performance using MSE and R² score

## Learning Outcome
- Understood how multiple features influence predictions
- Gained hands-on experience with regression models
- Learned model evaluation techniques
